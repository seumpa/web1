  <p>When protection of sensitive application data is required by the MCPTT operator, the MCPTT session identity cannot contain identity information that is classed as sensitive such as the MCPTT ID or the MCPTT Group ID, as specified in subclause 4.8.
  The controlling MCPTT function and non-controlling MCPTT function send the MCPTT session identity towards the MCPTT client during MCPTT session establishment by including it in the Contact header field of the final SIP response to a session initiation request.
  The participating MCPTT function allocates a unique MCPTT session identity hosted at the participating MCPTT function for the MCPTT session when it receives a MCPTT session identity in the Contact header field of a SIP request or a SIP response from the controlling MCPTT function or non-controlling MCPTT function and includes it in the Contact header field of the SIP request or SIP response sent towards the MCPTT client. The participating MCPTT function maintains a mapping of the MCPTT session identities it sends to the MCPTT client to the corresponding MCPTT session identities received from the controlling MCPTT function.
  The MCPTT client can cache the MCPTT session identity until a time when it is no longer needed.</p>
